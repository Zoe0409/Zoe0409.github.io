My name is Zoe and I graduated from Columbia University in December 2019, where my study focused on computer and information science. Also, I have worked in a start-up as a data scientist to help them build a personalized recommendation engine and make business decisions supported by data analysis results. 

<br><br>
My career interests lie in data analysis. I define myself as an analytical and detailed oriented professional who blends academic training in data analytics with hands-on professional experience from a top tier consulting firm. I am conversant with machine learning techniques and statistical concepts, and I have proven ability in crafting engaging stories around data and deriving insights from them. Feel free to look at my <a href="https://zoe0409.github.io/projects" target="_self">Projects</a> and my <a href="https://zoe0409.github.io/experiences" target="_self">Experiences</a> to learn more!
